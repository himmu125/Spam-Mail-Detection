# Spam-Mail-Detection
Project on Spam mail detection using machine learning. Implemented on jupyter notebook in Python language.

In this Machine Learning project I have trained the ML model using structed and well labeled data. Logistic Regression algoristhm is used for the model as to predict weather a mail is spam or ham on the basis of the data that has been fed to it.

Description of the code :-
Libraries of python used in this project : sklearn, pandas and numpy.
1. Data collection and Data Preprocessing.
2. Feature Extraction
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
4. Evaluation of Tranined Model
5. Buildng of Predictive System

Thank you
